# OpenGL Maze Implementations
Welcome to the "OpenGL Maze Implementations" repository, an interactive application designed for learning and exploring fundamental concepts in computer graphics using OpenGL. This project was implemented during the seventh semester, in the course MYY702 of the curriculum of the University of Ioannina. The final grade of the project 1A is 97 out of 100, of 1B is 100 out of 100 and 1C is 93 (excluding the additional 30 bonus points)out of 100.


## Project Overview
The three projects (1A, 1B and 1C) are a graphical application that simulates a maze environment, including interactive movement of characters, 3D rendering, and dynamic camera perspectives. Each stage focuses on building specific functionalities and refining user experience with OpenGL features.


## Key Features
- Interactive Character Movement: Move a character through a maze while maintaining grid alignment.
- 3D Rendering: Render 3D objects like walls and characters for a realistic experience.
- Camera Control: Navigate the environment with flexible camera controls.
- Texture Mapping: Apply textures to objects to enhance visual quality.
- Dynamic Object Behavior: Includes periodic appearance of a "treasure" with randomized locations.


## Assignment Breakdown
**Stage 1A: Basic 2D Maze**
- Open a 750x750 window and render a 2D maze.
- Implement movement for a square character that remains centered on the grid paths.
- Resolve GLFW key handling for smooth input processing.

**Stage 1B: Transition to 3D**
- Upgrade the environment to 3D rendering.
- Implement a 950x950 window and extend maze functionalities.
- Add camera perspective controls and synchronize with character movement.
- Introduce a 3D model for the main character.

**Stage 1C: Advanced Features**
- Incorporate dynamic object spawning for the "treasure" with texture mapping.
- Extend camera functionalities with panning and zooming.
- Introduce bonus features, such as additional object behaviors or advanced shaders.


## Implementation Details
- Programming Language: C++
- Graphics Library: OpenGL (GLFW and GLEW)
- Development Environment: Visual Studio 2022 (x64) on Windows 11 Home


## How to Run
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ChristosGkovaris/OpenGL-Maze-Implementations.git
     cd OpenGL-Maze-Implementations
